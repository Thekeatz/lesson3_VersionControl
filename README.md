## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (The first lesson I learned was how to sign up for Github. This was a very simple process and didnt cost me a cent thanks to the free option.
    just create a username and password not previously taken, pick your choice of membership and then bam youre in. )
2. (There are two ways a Git repository can be obtained. One way being taking a local directory that kis not under version control and converting it into a git repository
    The second way is to clone an already existing git repository)
3. (Git repository will take snapshots of your work everytime you deem necessary. However, you will never have to worry about saving the same thing multiple times because github wont re snapshot unless changes have been made.  )
