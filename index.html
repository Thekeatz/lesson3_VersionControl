            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git came to be in 2005. It was a new system created after Bitkeeper, a similar software, broke down. Git became everything Bitkeeper couldn't manage, in other words 
            the new and improved Bitkeeper. The makers of Git had a goal of giving Git great speed, a simple design, strong support from non-linear development, full distribution, 
            and the ability to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently. It didn't take long forepeople to realize it was an absolute success. 
Users began to notice incredible speed  and efficiency with any size projects. Not to mention the branching system was excellent. A job well done.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">People often mix up Git with other VCS. However, users must know that Git is much different. First off, Git thinks about its data in a different way. For example, VCS would store its information as a list of file
            based changes, instead Git thinks of its data as snapshots that create a small filesystem. Each time your work is saved, Git takes a picture and stores that snapshot for reference. In fact, if saved twice with zero 
            changes, Git will recognize that no changes have been made and that no picture must be stored. However, it will create a stream of snapshots each time the project is updated.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Getting a Git Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Getting a Git repository is incredibly important to the process. A Git repository can be obtained in one of two ways: the first option is taking a local directory that is 
            not under version control, and then turning it into a git repository. The next option is cloning an existing Git repository from elsewhere. If you want to the first route you should go to that projects directory, would enter certain commands which 
            would then create a new subdirectory. 
            If you want to go with the second
            option then all you need to do is go to that project and use the command “git clone”.

                <span class="text-muted">Recording changes in the Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Before you want to record any changes it is expected that you have a bona fide Git repository on your machine and a checkout/working copy of all the 
            files on that machine infront of you. A user should start recording changes in their repository overtime their project reaches a state that the user may want to record.
            Their are two categories that each file in your working directory can fall into: tracked or untracked. Tracked files are files recorded in the last snapshot, basically 
            files that git is aware of. Untracked files are files that Git is unaware of, files not contained in a previous snapshot. Its like a cycle, you make changes then commit those changes.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Set up and configuration your Github account is actually very simple. Github has a free option that is often utilized by students.
            After visiting the website you just need to create an untaken username followed by your email and the password of your choice. Then click Sign In! 
            Verify your account through your email and you are good to go. From their you can make edits to your profile such as giving yourself a new avatar. 
            An important step before clocking out is taking care of your emails section. You must enter all the correct emails that you will be using/ linked to your account. This is the way Git maps your commits.</p>
